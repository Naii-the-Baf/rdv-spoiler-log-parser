# Randovania Spoiler Log Parser
Reads a spoiler file produced by [Randovania](https://github.com/randovania/randovania), and returns a view of items. The purpose of this tool is to make spoiler logs easily and quickly readable, primarily for spoiler log races.

A tool for this purpose was [made previously using Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JTMr1bqu33ng2b5X9IVmFFgltN88k8Bi6Ee8h4d8a3s/edit?gid=1414799479#gid=1414799479); and this is a rework of it as a python application, as it has become increasingly more difficult to maintain as new games are added.

Presets generated by **dev versions of Randovania** are not guaranteed to be able to be loaded, especially if the game is not in the latest stable version.
